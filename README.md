# yapblog
Yet another Python wrote blog software (people likes to reinvent wheels)

## why this project
Yes, I know there're plenty of blog software out there (even those wrote in Python there're tons), but I guess it doesn't matter how many wheels are there in the world, what matters is I like to invent a wheel and enjoy the process. It adds more fun if others like it, that's why I made it public.
