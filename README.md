Yet another Python wrote blog software (people likes to reinvent wheels)

## why this project
I've been working as a software engineer for more than 10 years. In all these years I haven't created a personal blog website, I used Microsoft Live Space for a while (maybe 1 ~ 2 years) but then it's closed, they do provide interfaces for me to migrate my posts to a WordPress shared web space, but the pages look ugly and my friends cannot access them easily, eventually all my posts are lost. It's very disencouraging for me to continue writing blogs after that.

But recently this idea hits me again, I wish and could foresee I'd continue software business until retire. I need a space to store the activities, thoughts, articles during my daily work and life. When I'm old, I could read them myself or share them with my family and friends. This idea hit me so strong that I'd like to create a standalone website, even it cost me nearly 1000 RMB every year and a lot of time to maintain it, I think it just worth it, because memory is priceless. It's not just a website actually, it's my memory.

And because of that, I'd like to work on a project for my blog website. And here it is.

## ok I understand it's a long and boring history, but why another blog software
I'm a software engineer you know, experienced if I can say that, it's not like working on an enterprise system which requires thouands of engineers working for years. I can complete it by my own, with time and patience.

Yes, I know there're plenty of blog software out there (even those wrote in Python there're tons), but I guess it doesn't matter how many wheels are there in the world, what matters is I like to invent a wheel and enjoy the process. It adds more fun if others like it, that's why I made it public.
